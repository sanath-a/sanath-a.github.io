        <p> Thanks for stopping by! I'm a computer science major at Northwestern University, looking to break into industry as a software developer. I've always
          enjoyed the process of building things and the problem solving that goes along with it - ever since I started out with LEGO robotics. Now that I've traded
          in building blocks for a text editor and the command line, I've been busy honing my skills working on a variety of projects in school and otherwise. Check out
          a couple of my projects below, and I'll be sure to keep this page updated with new adventures!

        <p> As an intern at the <a id = "link" href = "http://hallatscheklab.berkeley.edu"> Hallatscheck Evolutionary Dynamics</a> lab at UC Berkeley, I studied the evolutionary dynamics of bacteriophages (viruses that attack bacteria) that live in your gut.
            Bacteria have very short lifespans, making them a great model organism to study how evolution plays out over time. While there's plenty of research going on regarding the bacteria
            of the Human Gut Microbiome, there isn't a lot of literature about the viruses that also exist in the biome. Here, I look at a recently discovered virus dubbed "CrAssphage" (I didn't name it). </p>

        <p> As part of a design team in <a id = "link" href="https://design.northwestern.edu/programs/take-design-course/design-thinking-communication"> Northwestern's Design Thinking and Communication (DTC) </a>program, my team and I designed an innovative, custom-made scale for the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago.
           The AbilityLab uses custom harnesses to offload weight from patients that are relearning how to walk - but lacked a method to measure exactly how much weight is being offloaded. The scale uses an arduino
           along with two load cells to integrate into the AbilityLab's existing equipment and workflow easily. Check out our poster below. </p>
