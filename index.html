        <h3> A little about me -- </h3>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by! I'm a computer science major at Northwestern
           University, looking to break into industry as a software developer.
           I've always enjoyed the process of building things and the problem solving
         that goes along with it - ever since I started out with LEGO robotics. I've
         since traded in my Lego kits for IDEs and compilers. I've enjoyed diving deep
         into concepts in Computer Science, Design and Engineering at Northwestern
         and on my own. I've posted a few highlights from my work below and I'll be
         sure to keep this page updated with new adventures!

        <p> With an extended spring break and plenty of time on my hands thanks to COVID-19,
          I decided to be productive and pick up some new front-end skills. I decided to
          pay homage to my childhood and use the
          <a id = "link" href = "https://pokeapi.co/"> PokeAPI </a>
          to create an online Pokedex. And just like
          those old games, I got sort of obsessed with this project. That being said, I
          really enjoyed making this site, and hope to build it out more in the future. I built it
          with Typescript, React JS, and a little help from Webpackage.You can sift through all 964
          pokemon, and even search for a specific species! Take look using the link below.

        <p> For the final project of my <a id = "link" href = "https://hci330.github.io/winter2020/"> Human Computer Interaction Course</a>,
           my teammates and I created a sample website design to help people journal positive memories.
            This website uses barebones HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so we could
            really focus on the design process (no backend!). We went through multiple iterations
            of the site, with plenty of user testing. It's really simplistic,
            but we got really great reviews on the clean and beautiful UI. It's currently live,
            so feel free to poke around using the link below.

        <p> This is a toy Convolutional Neural Network, made for a small task for <a id = "link" href = "http://www.nalshurafa.com/">
           Northwestern's HABits lab</a>. There's no data here (due to privacy concerns), just my code. There are two CNNs
          trained on two different datasets (original and masked), but they have the same architecture.
          They're both simple: just two convolutional layers and one dense layer. Still, they achieved
          around 96% accuracy on our test datasets. I developed the CNNs using TensorFlow and wrote a neat
          function using OpenCV to pull frames from a video (which was the raw data source). The repository
          is linked below.

           Northwestern's Design Thinking and Communication (DTC) </a>program, my team
           and I designed an innovative, custom-made scale for the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago.
           The AbilityLab uses custom harnesses to offload weight from patients that are relearning how to walk -
           but lacked a method to measure exactly how much weight is being offloaded. The scale uses an arduino
           along with two load cells to integrate into the AbilityLab's existing equipment and workflow easily. Check out our poster below. </p>

        <p> As an intern at the <a id = "link" href = "http://hallatscheklab.berkeley.edu">
           Hallatscheck Evolutionary Dynamics</a> lab at UC Berkeley, I studied
           the evolutionary dynamics of bacteriophages (viruses that attack bacteria) that live in your gut.
            Bacteria have very short lifespans, making them a great model organism to
            study how evolution plays out over time. While there's plenty of research going on regarding the bacteria
            of the Human Gut Microbiome, there isn't a lot of literature about the
            viruses that also exist in the biome. Here, I look at a recently discovered
            virus dubbed "CrAssphage" (I didn't name it). </p>
